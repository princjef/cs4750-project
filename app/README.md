`app/` Directory
=============

This folder houses all of the files associated with the front-end application. This includes all of the scripts, styles, images, and templates that are requested by the browser. The default behavior of the static server is to follow paths relative to this directory. The folder structure is as follows:

```
app/
 |- assets/
 |- css/
 |- js/
 |- partials/
 |- scss/
```
